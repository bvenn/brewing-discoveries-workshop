# Brewing discoveries 

In 2018 our working group at RPTU Kaiserslautern our working group implemented a coffee logging service at two location on our campus. [CSBar](https://github.com/CSBiology/CSBar) enables the logging of Coffee, Beer, Beverages, and other products in our break rooms. The core is entirely written in FSharp, while the logging itself is facilitated by a RaspberryPi with touch display and a simple barcode scanner.
