    "## Statistical Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use statistical testing to determine whether or not a two samples differ from each other. Several tests exists, each of which tests another property or is suited for a different scenario. For more information on the tests provided by FSharp.Stats please check out the [documentation](https://fslab.org/FSharp.Stats/Testing.html) or the `FSharp.Stats.Testing` module. The result of statistical tests in most cases is a p value, that describes how likely the observed outcome is to occur by chance. A common significance threshold is 0.05. If the p value of the test you performed is below this threshold, your probability to make a type I error (false positive) is below 5 % which for many cases is a sufficient accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most popular hypothesis test is called t test and it is used to determine if the means of two samples differ significantly. For further insights please visit fslab [t test blog post](https://fslab.org/blog/posts/testing-t-test.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some conditions the samples should satisfy. They should be approximately normal distributed or follow a normal distribution shape. If this condition cannot be satisfied you should use a nonparametric test, as a Wilcoxon signed ranked test. If the variances of the samples you want to test differ a lot, you should use a Welch test instead. This t test alternative can be calculated by setting the `equal variances` parameter in `Testing.TTest.twoSample` to false.\n",
    "\n",
    "Task:\n",
    "Test wether a person drinks significantly more coffee per month than another. As you'll need a sufficient sample size, you can first plot the distribution of different people using histograms, box plots or violin plots.\n",
    "Hint: You can assume the distributions of \"Benedikt V.\" and \"Michelle Porter\" beeing normally distributed.\n"
